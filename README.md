# Regression-Model-Course-Project

This report is for the final course project for the Regression Models course, part of the John Hopkins Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

The purpose of the report is to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome) and answer the following questions:
1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
2. “Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”

This uses R to evaluate a series of Regression Models to quantify the effect of Transmission and other factors ion MPG
